# Hi, I'm Kieran. 

I'm an undergraduate student in the computer science program at the university of Calgary, along with being a web services specialist there. I mostly focus on web development, system scripts, automation, and devops though I am familiar with a range of other fields. I have been developing for 3 years with extensive experience in python, as well as being comfortable with Java, Go, Rust, and a few other languages.
